# Maze Generator and Solver

## Description
- Implement an interactive web-based maze generator and solver using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- Apply depth-first search (DFS) for maze generation, and breadth-first search (BFS) for path solving.
- Build adjustable difficulty calibration logic by computing distance maps with BFS.
- Dynamically renders mazes and solution paths to improve algorithm explainability and user interaction.
- Optimize by separating the generation and solving modules, ensuring scalability for larger grid sizes.
